This simple sketh will print the `analogRead()` values to check the reading when using a set
of buttons that connect to an analog pin. The values are printed on the LCD and in the Serial Monitor.

For example, my LCD screen has 5 buttons which read 638 for `select`, 407 for `left`, 0 for `right`, 98 for `up` and 254 for `down`.
